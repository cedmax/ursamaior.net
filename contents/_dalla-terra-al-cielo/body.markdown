The path that leads us to discover the 4 elements is, at the same time, a 
journey through different continents, that touches different cultures.
The performance has been developed by some readings created for the Festival 
Somnio ergo Sum, promoted by the Fondazione 
del Monte di Bologna e Ravenna.
