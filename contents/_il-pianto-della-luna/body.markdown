What would happen if men began to pollute not only the earth but also the moon?

Celeste and Serafino do tell us. Their cousin Sgrunf is a very impolite and dirty child.

Our story begins during a summer night. An old couple is looking at the falling stars and thinks of youth. As it is a magic night, they become children again and our story can unfold: Celeste and Serafino decide to go to the moon but unluckily Sgrunf wants to go along and leaves tracks of his passage everywhere on the way.

The audience will cooperate in cleaning the moon. Performance has been created by a physical score of the actresses.
