Antigone belongs to a primitive world where reason confines with an
imaginary reality; where the future can be read in the fires of the sacrifices
and in the flights of the birds, where the Gods display themselves with
thunderbolts and storms, and the Nature takes part in the Mortals’ misfortunes.

In this world Antigone opposes the law of love to human's law, and she is defeated.
“Great words of prideful men are ever punished with great blows. Wisdom is the supreme part of happiness.”
