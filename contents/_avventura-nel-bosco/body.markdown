This performance has been inspired by the well known fairy-tale *Hansel and Gretel*, where the two brothers go through the impediments and fears of childhood and finally find their independence.

They support each other along the path and in the end become the familyâ€™s pillar.

Colors, images, music and rhythms tell everything, with the typical levity of fairy-tales.
