Mela is a dark comedy about Time.
Mela is a badly sewn patch in front of which we can't but cover our eyes.
Three women, three different forces, three generations facing each other.
Each one represents the collapse of idealisms and morals built 
and reaffirmed by the previous generation. Idealisms that, more than 25 years later, 
are still call into question in building a contemporary society.
