Mela is a dark comedy about Time.
Mela is a badly sewn patch in front of which we can't but cover our eyes.
Three women, three generations facing each other.
Each one represents the collapse of the principles built
and reaffirmed by the previous generation. Principles that, more than 25 years later, are still call into question in building a contemporary society.
