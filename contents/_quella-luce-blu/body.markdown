A ghostly Marie Curie, almost evoked by Irene, her daughter, who affectionately 
goes along her mother’s crazy dialogue with an old radio.
Marie doesn’t want her life to be investigated with voyeurism, but she lets 
her memories flow like a fairy-tale of love.

The performance has been developed from “Il fuoco del radio. Dialoghi 
con Madame Curie”, promoted by the Committee for Equal Opportunities of 
Padua University.
